# Gomoku AI: Unleashing Strategic Intelligence

ðŸš€ Built an AI-powered Gomoku game that pits three advanced strategies against each other:  
ðŸ”¹ **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** â€“ The calculated risk-taker, balancing exploration and exploitation.  
ðŸ”¹ **Alpha-Beta Pruning** â€“ The tactical mastermind, optimizing decision trees with precision.  
ðŸ”¹ **Policy-Value Network** â€“ The deep learning strategist, predicting the boardâ€™s fate with neural intelligence.

## **What I Did**  
ðŸ”¹ Engineered the game engine, AI models, and UI using **Python & Tkinter**.  
ðŸ”¹ Simulated AI vs. AI & Human vs. AI matches, evaluating win rates, move efficiency, and decision speed.  
ðŸ”¹ Conducted a comparative analysis, revealing MCTSâ€™s adaptability, Alpha-Betaâ€™s efficiency, and Policy-Valueâ€™s strategic depth.  
ðŸ”¹ Explored hybrid AI models, showcasing their potential in decision-making systems.
